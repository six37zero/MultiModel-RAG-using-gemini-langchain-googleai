**Multi-Model RAG with Gemini, LangChain, and Google AI Studio
**This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline utilizing Google's Gemini models, LangChain, and Google AI Studio to process both text and image data. The system leverages vector databases (FAISS) and Google Generative AI embeddings to enhance retrieval-based answering.

Features
Multi-Modal AI Integration: Uses Gemini models to handle text and image inputs.
Document Processing: Loads and splits text for better retrieval.
Vector Search with FAISS: Implements an efficient document retrieval system.
LangChain RAG Pipeline: Builds a retrieval-augmented generation workflow.
Google AI Studio API: Uses Generative AI models from Google.
